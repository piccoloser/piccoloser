# About Me
Self-taught software architect and developer, mechanical keyboard and typing enthusiast, musician, and generally creative individual. In love with Rust and Svelte. Most of my work is done in private repos, but surely there's something interesting lying around here...

I'm an [avid typist](https://monkeytype.com/profile/_piccoloser) with a personal best of 180WPM (15s, basic English, Dvorak layout) on a keyboard I built myself. [I actually have two of them](https://imgur.com/gallery/V6pnpEd).

I can best be reached via Instagram [@_piccoloser](https://instagram.com/_piccoloser).
