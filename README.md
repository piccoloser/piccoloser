# About Me
I'm primarily a Python developer, but I'm currently focusing on software design. I started in April of 2012 with basic web design, then picked up Python a couple years later. I'm in the process of learning Rust as of 2020.

As for my non-programming skills and hobbies, I'm an independent musician, photographer, graphic designer, video editor, and writer/editor. My biggest flex is a consistent triple-digit typing speed and the fact that I use the Dvorak keyboard layout.

The best way to get me talking is to talk about music, specifically Experimental music, or speculative science.

It's easiest to reach me via Instagram @_piccoloser
