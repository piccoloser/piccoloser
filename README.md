# About Me
I'm primarily a Python developer, but I'm currently focusing on software design. I started in April of 2012 with basic web design, then picked up Python a couple years later. I'm in the process of learning Rust as of 2020.

I'm an independent musician, photographer, graphic designer, video editor, and writer/editor. I'm also getting into mechanical keyboards, and my daily driver is a 40% ortholinear I built myself.

The best way to get me talking is to speculate about pretty much anything.

It's easiest to reach me via Instagram @_piccoloser
