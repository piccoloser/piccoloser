# About Me
I'm a self-taught fullstack developer. I generally favor Rust for everything, but I'll use Svelte for frontend work.

I consider myself an avid typist. My personal best is 161WPM (15s, basic English). I type on a custom mechanical keyboard that I built myself, and that's where I get my best speeds. [I actually have two of them](https://imgur.com/gallery/V6pnpEd).

Most of my work is done in private repos, but surely there are some interesting things lying around here...

# Personal Life
I'm a musician (singer/songwriter), graphic designer, former mechanical keyboard enthusiast, and gearhead. I've been songwriting since grade school and releasing music since middle school. I've also taken interest in goth and alternative fashion.

I can usually be reached via Instagram [@_piccoloser](https://instagram.com/_piccoloser).

## Programmer

I'm a self-taught developer aiming for fullstack. I've made websites, web-applications, automation scripts, and GUI applications to handle various tasks. I consider myself language-agnostic, but if I were to choose it would be split between Python and Rust. The vast majority of my projects have been vanilla-focused, not specializing in any particular libraries or frameworks.

I implement practices from both OOP and functional programming in my code, and I'm very careful with my design. To add to that, I make a point of documenting my work and making sure that I never again have to scan through my own code trying to figure out what it does.

## Outside the Office

I'm a musician, graphic designer, mechanical keyboard enthusiast, and gearhead. I've been songwriting since grade school and releasing music since middle school. My music is Experimental with influences from EDM, ambient, pop, blues, post-rock, and harsh noise.

<!-- Old About Me (Changed 7/24/2022)
I'm primarily a Python developer, but I'm currently focusing on software design. I started in April of 2012 with basic web design, then picked up Python a couple years later. I'm in the process of learning Rust as of 2020.

I'm an independent musician, photographer, graphic designer, video editor, and writer/editor. I'm also getting into mechanical keyboards, and my daily driver is a 40% ortholinear I built myself.

The best way to get me talking is to speculate about pretty much anything.

It's easiest to reach me via Instagram @_piccoloser
